Objective -->
The python file "Thesaurus" takes an input word from the user and shows its meaning.

Data.json file -->
This file contains words and their meanings in lowercase words.
Also, there are words having uppercase first letter (for e.g, Delhi, Paris).
It also contains uppercase words (like USA, NATO).
 
Logic -->

1. Import json and load the data from the file "data.json"
    This json file contains all the words and its meanings.
2. From difflib import get_close_matches.
     get_close_matches is used to find similar words from given data.
3. Now we define a function find(x).
        In the next step we lower the letters of the input word (by lower()) as the data in "data.json" contains lowercase words.
        Now if the input word is given in "data.json" then its gives the output (i.e, meaning of the word)
        Else if the condition fails then we capitalize the first letter of the word (by capitalize()).
        Else if that condition also fails  then we capitalize the word (by upper()) and try to find the meaning of the word.
        Else if the condition fails then we use get_close_matches to find similar words.
            For that we state a condition that if there are more than zero similar words then give suggestion 
            Else return "We didn't understand your entry"
        Else (if none of the above conditionns follows) then return "The word doesn't exist. Please double check it."
4. Take input from user and apply find() function.
5. If the word contains more than one meaning then for a user friendly output use iteration.
6. Finally get the result. :)
